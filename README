With the advent of music streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, we live in an age where it is incredibly easy to access any kind of music.  As the average listenerâ€™s curiosity and desire for new music has increased, streaming platforms have adopted a combination of human curators and computer algorithms to help create personalized playlists that they believe the listener will enjoy. The vast majority of such playlists consist of individual songs from a mishmash of artists. However, it is in the album format that artists originally intended their music to be listened. Indeed, a significant portion of the population, like me for instance, would like to receive suggestions for entire albums, based on say some seed album or desired genre/mood. I am proposing to develop such an album recommender application.
